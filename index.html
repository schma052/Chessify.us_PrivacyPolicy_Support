                <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p> Chessify.us includes iMessage functionality. Inside iMessage you may use our app to send a chess game invitation to someone in your contacts. We do not have access to your phone number, messages, or any personal data associated with iMessage. The ONLY thing we do inside iMessage is build the User Interface to play chess, and build and read the chess messages when iMessage sends and recieves them. The iMessage portion of Chessify.us basically sends FEN notation (chess board in text) to contact after you make and move on your turn, then recieves thier response and displays it. For the main App excluding the iMessage piece: </p>
                <p>We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create an account, including your username and password (all sensitive information is encrypted before storage so we never see it). We may also collect information about your gameplay and app usage.</p>
                
                <p>In totality we collect: usernames, hashed passwords, account creation time, time last logged in, hashed security question answers, money value (in-game currency quantity), email address (for account recovery), ELO rating (skill level), one authentication token when logging in that expires in 1 hour, one game-id-token per game is created and stored if authentication token creates or joins a game (game tokens delete after 24 hours), game move-histories are stored with their game token and deleted at the same time, and skins (sprites) acquired.</p>

                <div class="data-deletion-notice">
                    <p><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> All data associated with a user may be deleted at any time by pressing the Delete Account button found in the User Profile section. It deletes all user data from the server.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="data-deletion-notice">
                    <p><strong>Inactive Users:</strong> Users who have not signed in for the last 365 days will have their accounts deleted (wiping all data).</p>
                </div>

                <p>Data is collected when you, the user, enter it and supply it. THE ONLY data collected behind the scenes is the GMT-7 time you created your account, GMT-7 time of when you last played, your authentication token and associated game tokens. The username, password, security question answers, email, money amount, skins unlocked, and ELO rating are all up-front and require your permission and explicit action. Blocked users are stored and handled locally; we (the server) do not store who you personally block.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and improve our services, including to facilitate gameplay, track progress, and enhance user experience.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>We DO NOT profit from user data. We DO NOT want to store your data, we just have to so the app can function and change UI and settings based on the user.</p>
                </div>

                <p>We use your data to generate game rooms for you to play chess in, and to track your progress in those rooms. We save the chess piece skins data so you get what you spent time unlocking. ELO rating is so you can compare yourself in chess skill against others. Everything else is for account recovery.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>4. Information Sharing</h2>
                <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
                <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. All passwords and security question data is stored in a SHA256 hashed format, making it unreadable to anyone looking (even us).</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>6. Terms of Use</h2>
                <p>By using Chessify.us, you agree to use the app in accordance with these terms. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.</p>
                
                <p>Our in-game currency (moneys) is not and will never be monetized. It is rewarded through in-game accomplishments and is only used to buy specific cosmetic items. Users cannot use real money to buy in-game currency or these specific cosmetic items. These cosmetic items may only be obtained through regular gameplay. In this way 'moneys' acts as another form of score for the player to accumulate.</p>

                <p>All Guest Accounts are deleted within 24 hours after creation; any data the user provides will be deleted as well. By playing the app, the data necessary for it to function will be collected and stored on our side. If you create an acount starting with "HmnGst" then it will be treated as a guest account by the server. Do not be surprised when it is deleted. App store purchases are restorable; Purchases using the in-game currency are not. </p>

                <p>If creating an account, the only mandatory data is the username, password (we only see and store the SHA256 hashed password, which is fully encrypted and private), registration date, last time you logged in, money amount, ELO rating, authentication token, game ID tokens, and game histories (for the last 24 hours). ALL other data submission is OPTIONAL.</p>

                <p>If using a Guest Account, the username and password are also optional. The data collected for if-and-what skins are owned by the player is optional if the player avoids purchasing cosmetics. Email and Account Recovery Questions data is used for account recovery and is optional.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>WE WILL NEVER EMAIL YOU. WE WILL NEVER SELL YOUR EMAIL. WE WILL NEVER SHARE, SELL, or USE ANY ACCOUNT RECOVERY or EMAIL data for anything other than account recovery.</p>
                </div>

                <p>If you do not supply this data, the app will function perfectly except, forgetting your password means account deletion.</p>

                <p>Our only form of monetization is through In-App-Purchases for specific cosmetic non-consumable items. All In-App-Purchases go through Apple and are handled between your client app and Apple servers. The 'Restore Purchases' button seen in the In-App-Purchase store will restore any purchases your AppleID has made on other devices. Purchases made with real money through Apple will be available for Purchase Restoration, but purchases using in-game currency are tied to the account and cannot be restored if the account is lost.</p>
                <p>Purchases made with real money are completely seperate from the content accessable through in-game currency. One will never unlock the other. The use of real-world currency to buy, sell, or trade in-game currency (moneys) is strictly prohibited and against our policies.</p>
